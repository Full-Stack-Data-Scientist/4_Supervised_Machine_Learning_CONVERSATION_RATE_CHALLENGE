#  __Project__ ðŸš§
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. 
They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. 
They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate. They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

----------------

# __Goals__ ðŸŽ¯

* An EDA with the preprocessings to train a baseline model
* improve the model's f1-score on the test set (feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
* Make some predictions and dump the predictions into a .csv file
* Analyze your best model's parameters

----------------

# __Deliverables__ ðŸ—ƒ

A notebook with:
* visualisations
* captions and interpretations 
* Predictions of conversions and their performances evaluated (f1, confusion matrices)
